# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines a comprehensive refactor of the Buzzword Bingo application to improve user experience and code maintainability. The main goals are to consolidate card creation functionality into the sidebar, implement proper state management, fix PDF export issues, and clean up technical debt.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unified Card Creation Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and edit bingo cards using a sidebar interface while seeing a live preview, so that I can efficiently design cards without switching between different views.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a sidebar with card creation controls and a main area with a bingo card preview
2. WHEN I enter a card title THEN the system SHALL immediately update the preview card title
3. WHEN I add or modify terms THEN the system SHALL immediately update the preview card with the new terms
4. WHEN I select a free space icon THEN the system SHALL immediately update the preview card's free space
5. IF I have insufficient terms THEN the system SHALL display validation messages and disable card generation
6. WHEN I have valid card data THEN the system SHALL enable all card actions (export, share, etc.)

### Requirement 2: Centralized State Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized state management for card data, so that all components can access and modify card properties consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN card data changes THEN the system SHALL update all dependent components automatically
2. WHEN multiple cards are generated THEN the system SHALL maintain state for each card variant
3. WHEN switching between single and multiple card views THEN the system SHALL preserve card data
4. WHEN exporting cards THEN the system SHALL access current card state reliably

### Requirement 3: Improved Multiple Card Layout

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view multiple card variants in a horizontal row layout, so that I can easily compare different arrangements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select multiple cards THEN the system SHALL display them in a horizontal scrollable row
2. WHEN viewing multiple cards THEN each card SHALL be clearly labeled with its variant number
3. WHEN the viewport is narrow THEN the system SHALL maintain usability with appropriate responsive behavior
4. WHEN I change the number of cards THEN the system SHALL update the layout immediately

### Requirement 4: Reliable PDF Export

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export bingo cards to PDF without the application hanging, so that I can print or share my cards reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click export PDF THEN the system SHALL generate the PDF without hanging or freezing
2. WHEN exporting single cards THEN the system SHALL create a single-page PDF
3. WHEN exporting multiple cards THEN the system SHALL create a multi-page PDF with one card per page
4. WHEN export fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with retry options
5. WHEN export succeeds THEN the system SHALL provide user feedback and download the file

### Requirement 5: Code Cleanup and Technical Debt Reduction

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused code and components, so that the codebase is maintainable and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL have no unused components or files
2. WHEN reviewing imports THEN the system SHALL have no unused imports or dependencies
3. WHEN reviewing functionality THEN the system SHALL have no duplicate or redundant code
4. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL have no TypeScript errors or warnings
5. WHEN running tests THEN all tests SHALL pass and cover the refactored functionality

### Requirement 6: Enhanced User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want a streamlined interface that makes card creation intuitive and efficient, so that I can focus on content rather than navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start using the app THEN the system SHALL provide a clear, single-screen interface
2. WHEN I make changes THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
3. WHEN I encounter errors THEN the system SHALL provide helpful guidance
4. WHEN I complete actions THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate success feedback
5. WHEN using the app on mobile THEN the system SHALL maintain full functionality with appropriate responsive design
