# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project transforms an existing buzzword bingo generator into a modern React application. The enhanced app will allow users to create custom bingo cards with their own keywords, generate multiple randomized variants, share cards with others, and export cards as PDFs for printing. The first version will focus on client-side functionality without login or database features, enabling future extensibility for user accounts and persistent storage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create custom bingo cards with my own list of keywords, so that I can play bingo games tailored to specific topics or events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a title for their bingo card THEN the system SHALL display the title prominently on the generated card
2. WHEN a user provides a list of keywords (minimum 24 terms) THEN the system SHALL populate a 5x5 bingo grid with these terms
3. WHEN a user specifies fewer than 24 terms THEN the system SHALL display an error message indicating insufficient terms
4. WHEN a user generates a card THEN the system SHALL randomly distribute the terms across the grid with the center space as "FREE"
5. WHEN a user wants to customize the free space THEN the system SHALL allow them to upload or specify an image URL for the center square

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate multiple randomized variants of my bingo card, so that I can create different versions for multiple players.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests multiple card variants THEN the system SHALL generate between 1-10 different randomized arrangements
2. WHEN generating variants THEN the system SHALL ensure each card has a different arrangement of the same terms
3. WHEN displaying multiple variants THEN the system SHALL show them in a grid layout for easy comparison
4. WHEN a user selects a specific number of variants THEN the system SHALL generate exactly that number of unique cards
5. IF the user has fewer than 24 terms THEN the system SHALL prevent variant generation and display an appropriate message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to share my bingo cards with friends and coworkers, so that we can all play the same game together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a bingo card THEN the system SHALL generate a shareable URL containing the card configuration
2. WHEN someone accesses a shared URL THEN the system SHALL display the bingo card in play mode without editing controls
3. WHEN sharing a card THEN the system SHALL encode the title, terms, and free space image in the URL parameters
4. WHEN a shared card is accessed THEN the system SHALL allow players to click squares to mark them as completed
5. WHEN a player marks squares THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback (highlighting or marking) for selected squares

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export my bingo cards as PDF files, so that I can print physical copies for offline play.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests PDF export THEN the system SHALL generate a downloadable PDF file containing the bingo card(s)
2. WHEN exporting multiple variants THEN the system SHALL include all generated variants in a single PDF document
3. WHEN generating PDF THEN the system SHALL maintain proper formatting and readability for standard paper sizes
4. WHEN the PDF is created THEN the system SHALL preserve the card title, terms arrangement, and free space image
5. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL ensure text is legible and squares are appropriately sized for marking by hand

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive interface for creating and managing my bingo cards, so that I can easily use the application without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first visits the application THEN the system SHALL display a clear form for entering card details
2. WHEN a user is creating a card THEN the system SHALL provide real-time preview of their bingo card
3. WHEN a user makes changes to terms or title THEN the system SHALL update the preview automatically
4. WHEN a user completes card creation THEN the system SHALL provide clear options for sharing, generating variants, and exporting
5. WHEN displaying the interface THEN the system SHALL be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides invalid input THEN the system SHALL display clear, actionable error messages
2. WHEN network issues occur during sharing THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest retry options
3. WHEN PDF generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide an error message and alternative options
4. WHEN the application encounters unexpected errors THEN the system SHALL log the error and display a user-friendly message
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL highlight the specific fields that need attention

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application architecture to support future enhancements, so that login and database functionality can be added later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the component structure THEN the system SHALL use modular React components that can be easily extended
2. WHEN implementing data management THEN the system SHALL use patterns that can accommodate future state management solutions
3. WHEN creating the sharing mechanism THEN the system SHALL design URL structures that can transition to database-backed sharing
4. WHEN building the user interface THEN the system SHALL include placeholder areas for future user account features
5. WHEN structuring the codebase THEN the system SHALL separate concerns to allow easy integration of authentication and persistence layers
