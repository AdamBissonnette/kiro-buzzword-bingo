I think I fixed it
Wait, that didnâ€™t work
All tests passed ðŸŽ‰
All tests failed ðŸ’€
One test is still failing
Let me try a different approach
Copy-paste error again
Why is this undefined?
Forgot a semicolon
Cannot import module
Node command not found
Python environment is broken
Session expired
You're out of credits
Upgrade to continue
Model timed out
Running it again just to be sure
Off by one error
Accidentally deleted everything
Rollback time
Refactor later
Stack Overflow has the same answer
ChatGPT hallucinated that library
Chat GPT thought it was Claude
Ignored prompt and did something random
Forgot to pip install
NPM install fixed it
Yarn vs npm war
Just need to restart the server
Cache issue again
Session too long
Now it compiles
Still doesnâ€™t compile
Tests for the tests
Rubber duck debugging moment
That worked locally
Works on my machine
Why is production different?
Silent error somewhere
Spaghetti code incoming
Magic numbers everywhere
Just add logging
Debugging print statements
Quick and dirty solution
Ship it anyway
Accidentally infinite loop
RegEx is the real boss fight
Forgot to save the file
Hot reloading didnâ€™t reload
Why is it so slow?
Thatâ€™s not deterministic
Async hell again
Let me just Google that
I accidentally deleted your database
